# AccessControl
Here I am sharing two scripts that works in a project called LOW COST ACCESS CONTROL USING FACIAL RECOGNITION. 

Resume

With the objective of contributing to an environment security, be it public or private, the present 
work aims to present a facial access control model.

The methodology consisted in the study of the techniques of recognition where the most advanced ones were chosen 
and they compete with technologies used by big companies of the market. The technique is based on Deep-Learning and works in real time.
There was also consultation with related works to ascertain the state of the art.

In order to test the recognition techniques, a prototype with carefully selected components was implemented 
to make it possible to carry out the tests while keeping the proposed low cost.

Finally the tests presented confirmed the release of the access with the expected safety and could be compared 
with devices present and commercialized in the market.

This work will be present to the Cefet teaching body as part of the requirements required to obtain the bacheor's degree in
control and automation engineering. After this presentantion I will dispose the work here.
